AJAX

Better interactivity
The use of asynchronous requests allows the clientâ€™s
browser to be more interactive and to respond quickly to
inputs.
Easier navigation
The use of AJAX can reduce connection to the server it
only has to be requested once.
Reduced bandwidth
Using AJAX, a web application can request only the
content that needs to be updated, hence this drastically
reduces the usage of bandwidth and loading time
